## CANVAS CODERS
Unleash Your Creativity Through Art And Code

Canvas Coders is an interactive educational platform that is transforming the learning experience with project-based learning, based on art and coding fundamentals, real-time peer-to-peer learning, and incentivizing progress web 3 rewards. This allows users to pair programs with other learners, as they work together to complete artistic coding challenges. As the learners progress, they are awarded proof-of-knowledge NFTs. These are verifiable on-chain and offer a unique opportunity for users to boost their resumes through verified credentials. Also, this provides an easy, novel, and convenient way to demonstrate knowledge to partner educational institutions and employment partners.

## NEXT STEPS & UPDATES
Canvas Coders plans to continue expanding its offerings and providing a personalized learning experience that helps early learners discover and adopt the tools to become lifelong learners of ART + STEAM. In the future, we hope to partner with schools and community centers to provide access to our platform to those who may not have the means to afford traditional art and coding education. We also plan to integrate emerging technologies such as virtual and augmented reality to provide an even more immersive learning experience.

On the technical side, we plan to continue to build with Owl Protocol and explore integrations with other Web 3 Tools, such as Lit Protocol for gated content based on NFTs held by users.

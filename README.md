## CANVAS CODERS
Unleash Your Creativity Through Art And Code

Canvas Coders is an interactive educational platform that is transforming the learning experience with project-based learning, based on art and coding fundamentals, real-time peer-to-peer learning, and incentivizing progress web 3 rewards. This allows users to pair programs with other learners, as they work together to complete artistic coding challenges. As the learners progress, they are awarded proof-of-knowledge NFTs. These are verifiable on-chain and offer a unique opportunity for users to boost their resumes through verified credentials. Also, this provides an easy, novel, and convenient way to demonstrate knowledge to partner educational institutions and employment partners.
